# About the bin directory

This directory contains the binary files output by the c++ compiler. This is specified in the .vscode/tasks.json file using the `/Fe:` arg for the windows flavour and the `-o` arg for the OSX flavour of the file. Both the windows executable hexflow (OSX binary) and hexflow.exe (Windows binary) are found here. Type `./hexflow` in the VSC terminal to execute the binary on both Windows and OSX.
